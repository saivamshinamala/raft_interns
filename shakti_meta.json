The EW system is designed for capital ships of Indian Navy with Electronic Support (ES) system covering the frequency band from 175 MHz to 40 GHz and Electronic Attack (EA) System covering threat radar frequency band of 6 to 40 GHz. The ES system also provides integral Radar Finger Printing System (RFPS) for fine grain intra pulse analysis and inter pulse analysis of the emitters that operate in the frequency range of 0.175 to 40 GHz. It is manufactured by Bharat Electronics Ltd and it is Designed and developed by DLRL, Hyderabad."

The ES system has broad band and narrow band operation to meet the tactical and strategic needs of the Navy. Broad band operation is achieved by employing a Wide Open Receiver, which achieves 100% Probability of Intercept (POI), whereas the narrow band receiver helps in achieving higher sensitivity and better Range Advantage Factor (RAF) against Low Probability of Intercept (LPI) radars."

The EA system is split into two bands, 6-18 GHz and 18-40 GHz band. The EA system is configured into two identical sub-systems, each covering 180\u02da sector on the ship platform one each on Port & Starboard sides. These are supported by a common EA processor for interface with ES system, control and power management of total EA system. The system is capable of handling ten (10) threats simultaneously covering 360 (i.e., four threats per sector of 180 in 6-18 GHz band and one threat per sector of 180 in 18-40 GHz band)."

The ES system covers a frequency range of 0.175 -40 GHz and EA system covers 6-40 GHz. In order to provide enhanced parameter specifications, functional features and modularity for ease of installation & maintenance, the system is configured with subsystems. The ES system provides integrated Radar Finger Printing capability. The ECM segment provides improved jamming features with incorporation of Digital Radio Frequency Memory (DRFM)."

In 6 -18 GHz band, the system is capable of handling eight threats simultaneously (four in each sector of Port and Starboard) using electronic beam steering concept with minimum overall reaction time of less than 2 Sec. In 18 -40 GHz band, the system can handle two threats (one in each sector of 180\u00b0) using servo driven pedestal with a reaction time of less than 5 sec. The EA system employs DRFM for generating effective Jamming technique thus enhancing the effectiveness of the jamming many fold in comparison with the conventional Jammer."

The dual fed dual polarized antennas for DF applications are used in Low Band system 0.175 \u2013 0.5 GHz. These antennas are designed to receive both horizontal and vertical polarized signals from any direction in Azimuth. Two antenna elements dipole and loop with separate connectors are integrated in a single antenna structure. Dipole antenna exhibits omni directional radiation characteristics for vertically polarized waves in azimuth plane for its vertical mounting. Similarly loop antenna placed horizontally in azimuth plane (loop axis vertical), provides omni directional radiation characteristics in azimuth plane for horizontally polarized waves. These antennas are designed to have large frequency bandwidth covering 175-500 MHz respectively without any tuning mechanism. This is accomplished by incorporating specially designed broadband impedance matching network."

ASU selects the particular polarization in antenna to be received based on commands from Receiver Processor (LB1) and connects the selected antenna bay to the DF Receiver. It accepts a calibration signal from the synthesized source for calibrating the RF cables and DF Receiver. ASU can be commanded to either connect antenna bay or inject calibration signals into the DF receiver. In the presence of external high power RF signal the receivers are connected to Cal/BITE port through a 'blanking pulse' control. Inside the CAL source receivers are further terminated to 50 ohms."

SCD will also be interfaced with LRSAM and KAVACH if the platform is equipped with them. The intercepted and analysed data of the ESM processor along with the results of identity search and the receiver activity status will be presented in graphical and alphanumeric formats. SCD presents HMI to the operator to configure and control receiver sub-systems through ES processor, perform jamming activities through EA processor of the EA sub-system. SCD will be interfaced with ESI for time, platform heading, positional information etc. Operator can select an ESM track on SCD HMI and send it to RFPS for finger printing. SCD will be interfaced with CMS for centralized command & controlling of Shakti EW system. The system controller and display also presents health status, diagnostics of the sub systems and the detailed library parameters for selected emitters.

However if it is inevitable and necessary to add new entries to this library, there should be space available in it, i.e. all the 20000 entries should not be filled. If the no. of entries is less than 20000, then Operator can add new entries to the library provided by EWOSC (Navy) otherwise Operator has to delete some existing entries (which are not so important) and make new entries. In SCD application, options are provided to Operator to delete/modify/existing entries in Emitter library, but it is not suggested to exercise these operations using SCD on the platform."
